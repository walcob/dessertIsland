Grease a 9-inch pie dish.\r\nPlace the brown sugar and butter in a mixing bowl, and beat them together with an electric mixer until creamy and very well combined, without lumps. Beat in eggs, one at a time, incorporating the first egg before adding the next one. Add the vanilla extract and salt; beat the flour in, a little at a time, and then the milk, making a creamy batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pie dish.\r\nBake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes; remove pie, and cover the rim with aluminum foil to prevent burning. Return to oven, and bake until the middle sets and the top forms a crusty layer, about 15 more minutes. Let the pie cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/yrstur1511816601.jpg","strTags":"Pie,Desert","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uVQ66jiL-Dc","strIngredient1":"Brown Sugar","strIngredient2":"Butter","strIngredient3":"Eggs","strIngredient4":"Vanilla Extract","strIngredient5":"Salt","strIngredient6":"Plain Flour","strIngredient7":"Milk","strIngredient8":"","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"2 cups ","strMeasure2":"\u00bc cup","strMeasure3":"2","strMeasure4":"1 tsp ","strMeasure5":"1 tsp ","strMeasure6":"\u00bd cup ","strMeasure7":"1 1\/2 cups ","strMeasure8":"","strMeasure9":"","strMeasure10":"","strMeasure11":"","strMeasure12":"","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"http:\/\/allrecipes.com\/recipe\/213595\/miraculous-canadian-sugar-pie\/","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null}]}
